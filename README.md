# StudentsProject
This is my first SQL project for a dataset I found on KAGGLE containing student's data. I also visualized it using Power BI

## Background
This dataset was found on kaggle and cleaned with Excel but queried with PostGreSQL.
It contains a population of 1000 students with columns math_score, reading_score,writing_score, race,parent_edu,avg_score, gender,test_prep and lunch

## Questions
The following questions were answered:
1. Does lunch affect the pass rate
2. Are females smarter than males?
3. Do parents have an impact on the children's education?
4. Is the test preparation course effective?
5. Does race have a role to play on pass rate?

## Answers
1. Lunch has a huge role to play with the pass rate. The quality of lunch significantly determines the pass rate. Those with standard lunch had a pass rate of 172 males and 225 females as compared to the free lunch that had pass rate of 58 males and 78 females.
2. Females are more effective. The population is made up of 518 females and 482 males. The females are more effective as they snagged the highest standard lunch, average pass scores except for maths and higher parental level of education. 
3. It was noted that the higher the level of parent's education the higher the pass rate. The race with the most learned parents was C and C also recorded the highest pass rate with an average score of 80. 
4. The test prep is fairly effective as those that did the test prep had a lower pass rate and lower fail rate with 107 males and 136 females passing and those that failed 48 females and 67 males than those who did not do the test prep having 167 females and 185 males failing and 123 males and 167 females passing
5. Race does not really have a role to play but rather the afctors that are present in race. The Least learned Race was A with the lowest score, 18. While the most effective race was C with an average score of 80 having the most standard meals, parental level of education and most females with high average scores. However race E had produced the highest average score of with one student getting full scores but with lower population as compared to C.

## Recommendations
1. Encourage more standard lunch
2. Encourage parents to further their level of education
3. Make the test prep course compulsory to reduce the fail rate
4. Have extra math class for girls and reading and writing class for boys

## Highlights
1. The pass mark was relatively high, 68. Females had a pass mark of 70 while males had a passamark of 66. 
2. Females had a pass mark of 64, 73 and 72 in maths, reading and writing respectively while males had a passmark of 69, 65 and 63 in maths, reading and writing respectively.

## Note
1. The pass rate is gotten by the avegrage mark gret=ater than or equal to the general pass mark which is 68.
